# iButton Splitter
## Desi Quintans

1. Install AutoHotKey (<https://www.autohotkey.com/>, Windows only).
2. Drop the `.csv` file generated by the TDHC software onto `_iButton Splitter.ahk`.
3. The file will be divided into separate `.csv` files, one file per iButton.
4. Files are placed into `iButton Splitter output/`, named by iButton serial number and the date the iButton was recorded.
5. If you want to automatically convert serial numbers to some other human-readable name, open `_iButton Splitter.ahk` in a text editor
   (e.g. Notepad) and go to the section around line 180 that looks like this:

  		Case-C200000038AFD421:
   			SerialNum1 = BIL-BPA Air
   			Break
		Case-1200000038A54021:
   			SerialNum1 = BIL-BPA Soil
   			Break

   The text after `Case-` is the iButton serial number. The text after `SerialNum1 = "`is the human-readable name you
   want to give that iButton. Edit this block of `Case` statements to give your iButtons names. For example, to name
   an iButton D1234567890000000 as "Site 2 Air Temperature", your case statement would be:

  		Case-D1234567890000000:
   			SerialNum1 = Site 2 Air Temperature
   			Break

   Delete any case statements that you don't need any more.
